=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a simple word segmenter. Like L<Text::TFIDF>, this class segments a sentence into words by spliting by spaces.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new([ lower_case => 0 ] [, remove_punctuations => 0 ] [, stop_words => [] ])

Constructor. Takes some optional parameters:

=over 2

=item lower_case

Set off by default. Convert all the words into lower cases.

=item remove_punctuations

Set off by default. Removes punctuation characters (e.g., commas, periods, quotes, question marks and exclamation marks) from head and tail of segmented words. Note that punctuations at inside of a word (e.g., "King's") will be remain unchanged.

=item stop_words

Specifies words you want to exclude from segmented words. This is useful for removing functional words.

Note that stop word filtering will be performed B<after> C<lower_case> and C<remove_punctuations> options are processed. So, for example, if you enable C<lower_case> option and want to exclude "I" from result, you should supply the stop word list as C<['i']>.

=back

=head2 segment($document | \$document)

Executes word segmentation on given C<$document> and returns an word iterator.
